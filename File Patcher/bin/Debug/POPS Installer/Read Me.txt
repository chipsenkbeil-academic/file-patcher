Version History:
[1.0.0]
-Created copy system.
-Added numerous POPS files.
-Created generic Windows GUI.
-Wrote "Read Me.txt" file.

Bugs:
[1.0.0]
-{FIXED} Attempting to copy files to a drive with 0 space provides an error (error checking not working).
 -Occurs for me (smchronos) with starup disk A:\ that appears to never be ready.

Reason: Simply put, I found it annoying to dig around for all of those POPS prx files and add them.
To me, it is much easier to just click and select the ones I want and then press GO! and it's done in a matter of seconds.
So, I built this program (1.0.0) in a matter of five hours (on and off).
Granted, it is still a little shaky, but it's getting there.
I have tested the uploaded POPS files using this program, specifically with Vagrant Story and Grandia for the PSX.
I have had no problems myself with uploaded files.
I've done about as much bug testing as I can think of with my single computer.
Please remember that I have only tested this on Windows XP.
